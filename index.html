                        <div class="desc">Julius Kambarage Nyerere was born on 13 April 1922 in Mwitongo, an area of the
                            village of Butiama in Tanganyika's Mara Region. He was one of 25 surviving children of
                            Nyerere Burito, the chief of the Zanaki people. Burito had been born in 1860 and given the
                            name "Nyerere" ("caterpillar" in Zanaki) after a plague of worm caterpillars infested the
                            local area at the time of his birth. Burito had been appointed chief in 1915, installed in
                            that position by the German imperial administrators of what was then German East Africa; his
                            position was also endorsed by the incoming British imperial administration. Burito had 22
                            wives, of whom Julius' mother, Mugaya Nyang'ombe, was the fifth. She had been born in 1892
                            and had married the chief in 1907, when she was fifteen. Mugaya bore Burito four sons and
                            four daughters, of which Nyerere was the second child; two of his siblings died in infancy.

                        <div class="desc">The British colonial administration encouraged the education of chiefs' sons,
                            believing that this
                            would help to perpetuate the chieftain system and prevent the development of a separate
                            educated
                            indigenous elite who might challenge colonial governance. At his father's prompting, Nyerere
                            began his education at the Native Administration School in Mwisenge, Musoma in February
                            1934,
                            about 35 km from his home. This placed him in a privileged position; most of his
                            contemporaries
                            at Butiama could not afford a primary education. His education was in Swahili, a language he
                            had
                            to learn while there. Nyerere excelled at the school, and after six months his exam results
                            were
                            such that he was allowed to skip a grade. He avoided sporting activities and preferred to
                            read
                            in his dormitory during free time.

                            study at Makerere
                            College in the Ugandan city of Kampala. He secured a bursary to fund a teacher training
                            course
                            there, arriving in Uganda in January 1943. At Makerere, he studied alongside many of East
                            Africa's most talented students, although spent little time socialising with others, instead
                            focusing on his reading. He took courses in chemistry, biology, Latin, and Greek. Deepening
                            his
                            Catholicism, he studied the Papal Encyclicals and read the work of Catholic philosophers
                            like
                            Jacques Maritain; most influential however were the writings of the liberal British
                            philosopher
                            John Stuart Mill. He won a literary competition with an essay on the subjugation of women,
                            for
                            which he had applied Mill's ideas to Zanaki society. Nyerere was also an active member of
                            the
                            Makere Debating Society, and established a branch of Catholic Action at the university.

                        <div class="desc">On leaving Makerere, Nyerere returned home to Zanaki territory to build a
                            house for his widowed
                            mother, before spending his time reading and farming in Butiama. He was offered teaching
                            positions at both the state-run Tabora Boys' School and the mission-run St Mary's, but chose
                            the
                            latter despite it offering a lower wage. He took part in a public debate with two teachers
                            from
                            the Tabora Boys' School, in which he argued against the statement that "The African has
                            benefitted more than the European since the partition of Africa"; after winning the debate,
                            he
                            was subsequently banned from returning to the school. Outside school hours, he gave free
                            lessons
                            in English to older locals, and also gave talks on political issues. He also worked briefly
                            as a
                            price inspector for the government, going into stores to check what they were charging,
                            although
                            quit the position after the authorities ignored his reports about false pricing. While in
                            Tabora, the woman whom Nyerere was arranged to marry, Magori Watiha, was sent to live with
                            him
                            to pursue her primary education there, although he forwarded her to live with his mother.
                            Instead, he began courting Maria Gabriel, a teacher at Nyegina Primary School in Musoma;
                            although from the Simbiti tribe, she shared with Nyerere a devout Catholicism. He proposed
                            marriage to her and they became informally engaged at Christmas 1948.

                            then travelled, by
                            train, from London to Edinburgh. In the city, Nyerere took lodgings in a building for
                            "colonial
                            persons" in The Grange suburb. Starting his studies at the University of Edinburgh, he began
                            with a short course in chemistry and physics and also passed Higher English in the Scottish
                            Universities Preliminary Examination. In October 1949 he was accepted for entry to study for
                            a
                            Master of Arts degree at the University of Edinburgh's Faculty of Arts; his was an Ordinary
                            Degree of Master of Arts which, in contrast to common uses of the term "Master of Arts", was
                            considered an undergraduate rather than postgraduate degree, the equivalent of a Bachelor of
                            Arts in most English universities.

                            Salaam in October 1952.
                            He took the train to Mwanza and then a lake steamer to Musoma before reaching Zanaki lands.
                            There, he built a mud-brick house for himself and his fiancé, Maria; they were married at
                            Musoma
                            mission on 24 January 1953. They soon moved to Pugu, closer to Dar es Salaam, when Nyerere
                            was
                            hired to teach history at St Francis' College, one of the leading schools for indigenous
                            Africans in Tanganyika. In 1953 the couple had their first child, Andrew. Nyerere became
                            increasingly involved in politics; in April 1953, he was elected president of the Tanganyika
                            African Association (TAA). His ability to take on the position was influenced by his good
                            oratorical skills and by the fact that he was Zanaki; had he been from one of the larger
                            ethnic
                            groups he may have faced greater opposition from members of rival tribes. Under Nyerere, the
                            TAA
                            gained an increasingly political dimension, devoted to the pursuit of Tanganyikan
                            independence
                            from the British Empire. Nyerere himself was, according to Bjerk, "catapulted to prominence"
                            as
                            "a standard-bearer of the burgeoning independence movement".

                            he toured the country almost continuously, often in TANU's Land Rover. The British colonial
                            Governor of Tanganyika, Edward Twining, disliked Nyerere, regarding him as a racialist who
                            wanted to impose indigenous domination over the European and South Asian minorities. In
                            December
                            1955, Twining established the "multi-racial" United Tanganyika Party (UTP) to combat TANU's
                            African nationalist message. Nyerere nevertheless stipulated that "we are fighting against
                            colonialism, not against the whites". He befriended members of the white minority, such as
                            Lady
                            Marion Chesham, a U.S.-born widow of a British farmer, who served as a liaison between TANU
                            and
                            Twining's government.[121] A 1958 editorial in the TANU newsletter Sauti ya Tanu (Voice of
                            TANU)
                            that had been written by Nyerere called on the party's members to avoid participating in
                            violence. It also criticised two of the country's district commissioners, accusing one of
                            trying
                            to undermine TANU and another of putting a chief on trial for "cooked-up reasons". In
                            response,
                            the government filed three counts of criminal libel. The trial took almost three months.
                            Nyerere
                            was found guilty, with the judge stipulating that he could either pay a £150 fine or go to
                            prison for six months; he chose the former.

                            which he presented a paper calling for the formation of an East African Federation. He
                            suggested
                            that Tanganyika could delay its attainment of independence from the British Empire until
                            neighbouring Kenya and Uganda were able to do the same. In his view, it would be much easier
                            for
                            the three countries to unite at the same point as independence than after it, for beyond
                            that
                            point their respective governments might feel that they were losing sovereignty through
                            unification. Many senior TANU members opposed the idea of delaying Tanganyikan independence;
                            the
                            party had been growing, and as of 1960 had over a million members.

                            ceremony at National
                            Stadium.[132] A law was soon presented to the Assembly that would restrict citizenship to
                            indigenous Africans; Nyerere spoke out against the bill, comparing its racialism to the
                            ideas of
                            Adolf Hitler and Hendrik Verwoerd, and threatened to resign if it passed. Six weeks after
                            independence, in January 1962 Nyerere resigned as Prime Minister, intent on focusing on
                            restructuring TANU and trying to "work out our own pattern of democracy". Retreating to
                            become a
                            parliamentary back bencher, he appointed close political ally Rashidi Kawawa as the new

                            Minister. He toured the country, giving speeches in towns and villages in which he
                            emphasised
                            the need for self-reliance and hard work. In 1962, his alma mater at Edinburgh awarded
                            Nyerere
                            with a Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws.

                            Nyerere moved into
                            the State House in Dar es Salaam, the former official residence of British governors.
                            Nyerere
                            disliked life in the building, but remained there until 1966. Nyerere appointed Kawawa his
                            Vice
                            President. In 1963, he put his name forward to be Rector of Edinburgh University, vowing to
                            travel to Scotland whenever needed; the position instead went to the actor James Robertson
                            Justice. He made official visits to West Germany, the United States, Canada, Algeria,
                            Scandinavia, Guinea, and Nigeria. In the U.S. he met President John F. Kennedy and although
                            they
                            personally liked each other, he failed to convince Kennedy to toughen his stance on

                            and Indians left, as did most of the island's British community. Western powers were
                            reluctant to recognise Karume's government, whereas the Soviet Union, Eastern Bloc, and
                            People's
                            Republic of China quickly did so and offered the country aid. Nyerere was angry at this

                            Tanzania, although
                            parliamentary elections occurred only on the mainland and not on Zanzibar. Although the
                            one-party state meant that only TANU candidates could stand, the party's national executive
                            selected multiple candidates for all but six seats, providing some democratic choice for
                            voters. Two ministers, six junior ministers, and nine backbenchers lost their seats and
                            were replaced. Both Derek Bryceson and Amur Jamal, the two non-indigenous cabinet members,
                            were re-elected over black opponents. Nyerere stood unopposed in the presidential election,
                            although the ballot allowed space to vote against his candidacy; ultimately he secured
                            nearly

                            There, he
                            presented its Committee with a new statement of party principles: the Arusha
                            Declaration.
                            This declaration affirmed the government's commitment to building a democratic socialist
                            state
                            and stressed the development of an ethos of self-reliance. In Nyerere's view, true
                            independence was not possible while the country remained dependent on gifts and loans from
                            other
                            nations. It stipulated that renewed emphasis should be placed on developing the peasant
                            agricultural economy to ensure greater self-sufficiency, even if this meant slower economic
                            growth. After this point, the concept of socialism became central to the government's
                            policy formation. To promote the Arusha Declaration, groups of TANU supporters marched
                            through the countryside to raise awareness; in October, Nyerere accompanied one such
                            eight-day
                            march which covered 138 miles in his native Mara district.

                            in the Ugandan city of Kampala. In 1997, he gave a speech marking the fortieth anniversary

                            growing European unity within the European Union as a model for African states to imitate.
                            In the late 1990s he also reflected on his presidency, noting that although he made
                            mistakes,
                            particularly in prematurely pursuing nationalisation, he stood by the principles of the
